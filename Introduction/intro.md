<h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.


<h1>Getting started with Javascript</h1>
To run a JavaScript code :

1. Open a text editor like Visual Studio Code or Notepad to write your JavaScript code.
2. Save the file with a `.js` extension, for example, `my-script.js`.
3. Open a web browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect") and navigate to the "Console" tab.
4. Link your JavaScript file in an HTML document using a `<script>` tag or simply paste your code directly into the console and press Enter to see the output.

Here's your first javascript code:
```javascript
// This is a JavaScript code block
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
sayHello();
```
open the console, copy the following code, and paste it in at the prompt and press Enter.

For now do not worry about the syntax, we'll understand it in detail later.
