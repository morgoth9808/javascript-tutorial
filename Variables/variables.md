# Variables

In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. They act as containers that hold different types of values, such as numbers, strings, or objects, which can be used and manipulated throughout your code. Variables are an essential concept in programming, and understanding how to declare and initialize them is fundamental.

## Declaring Variables

To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword, followed by the variable name. The choice of which keyword to use depends on the scope and mutability of the variable.

- **var** : Variables declared with `var` have function scope or global scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the function or script in which they are declared. However, they have some issues like hoisting and are less commonly used now.
- **let** : Variables declared with `let` have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined. `let` variables can be reassigned.
- **const** : Variables declared with `const` are also block-scoped, but they cannot be reassigned after their initial value is assigned. However, for objects and arrays declared with `const`, their properties or elements can be modified.
 
The names of variables, called `identifiers`, conform to certain rules. A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 â€“ 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).

```javascript
// Variable declaration
var name; 
const country = "Japan";
let age;
```
## Initialization

Initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable when it is declared. Variables can be declared and initialized in the same statement or separately.

```javascript
// Initialization
var firstName = "John"; // Declaration and initialization in one step
var lastName;
lastName = "Malkovich"; // Declaration and initialization separately
```

## Variable Scope

In JavaScript, variable `scope` refers to the context in which a variable is declared and where it can be accessed or modified. Understanding variable scope is crucial because it determines the visibility and lifetime of variables in your code. JavaScript has two main types of variable scope: global scope and local (or block) scope.

- ### Global Scope
  Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in your code, including within functions or blocks. However, using global variables should be done          carefully because they can lead to unexpected behavior and make your code less maintainable.
    
```javascript
        // Variable with global scope
        var globalVar = "I'm global";
        function exampleFunction() {
            console.log(globalVar); // Accessible within the function
        }
        exampleFunction();
        console.log(globalVar); // Accessible outside the function
```
 
   - ### Local (Block) Scope
     Variables declared within a function or a block (enclosed by curly braces) have local scope. They are only accessible within that specific function or block. This helps prevent naming conflicts and keeps           your code modular.
        ```javascript
           function exampleFunction() {
            // Variable with local scope
            var localVar = "I'm local";
            console.log(localVar); // Accessible within the function
        }
        exampleFunction();
        console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
        ```

  - ### Block Scope with let and const
    In modern JavaScript, you can use `let` and `const` to declare variables with block scope. Unlike `var`, which has function scope, let and const are limited to the block in which they are defined, such           as an if statement or a for loop
```javascript
        if (true) {
        // Block-scoped variable
            let blockVar = "I'm block-scoped";
            console.log(blockVar); // Accessible within the block
        }

        console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
```

- ### Function Scopes
   Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped. This means they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared, but they are not accessible outside of that function.
```javascript
function exampleFunction() {
            if (true) {
            // Function-scoped variable
                var functionVar = "I'm function-scoped";
                console.log(functionVar); // Accessible within the function
            }

            console.log(functionVar); // Accessible within the function
        }

        exampleFunction();
        console.log(functionVar); // Error: functionVar is not defined outside the function
```
